Bandit Attack
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
As you get close to the city gate, you suddenly have a strong feeling that somebody is watching you. You look around, trying to
calm your nerves. There are some faint whispers coming from the nearby bushes. As you try to focus your ears on the voices, they
are suddenly replaced by loud screaming and a gang of bandits runs out of the bushes, heading straight towards you. These are not 
amateurs, and it looks like they have been stalking the city entrace for quite some time.

You prepare yourself for a tough fight...
