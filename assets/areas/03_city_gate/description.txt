The city gate seems to be in a great state of disrepair. It's obvious that this city doesn't get too many visitors, and even those 
who manage to get here are immediatelly attacked by bandits and robbed of their possessions. This city is most probably a safe 
haven for various pirates and criminals searching for a place to hide from the constant pursuit by the forces of law. 

As you venture through the gate, you see a few guardsmen posted here, but none of them greets you or tries to find out who you 
are. Clearly they accept anyone to come into this city as long as they don't cause trouble. 

Right past the gate there is a small inn. I hope that the barkeep is much more talkative than the guards...
