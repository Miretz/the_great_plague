|The city gate seems to be in a great state of disrepair. It's obvious that it doesn't get too many visitors, and even those 
|who manage to get here are immediatelly attacked by bandits and robbed of their possessions. This city is most probably a safe 
|haven for various pirates and criminals searching for a place to hide from the constant pursuit by the forces of law. 
|
|As you venture through the gate, you see a few guardsmen posted here, but none of them greets you or tries to find out who you 
|are. Clearly they accept anyone to come into this city as long as they don't cause trouble. 
|
|Right past the gate there is a small inn. I hope that the barkeep is much more talkative than the guards...
