As you step out of the ship you feel relieved. Finally stable ground under your feet after such a long time. You look around 
trying to figure out the way to the city. After a few steps towards the trees, you suddenly hear a female voice calling out 
your name. You recognize this voice. It is Dansea, the butcher's daughter, a Felidae girl you know from your home village. 
Before the plague started, she used to be a hunter. She approaches you with a bow in her hand.
